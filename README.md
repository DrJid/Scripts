Crowd Sourcing your stories!!! 
- Built at Fall Mhacks 2013

Scripts enables users to create and contribute to stories that are shared accross the world. Each user will be able to watch their story grow as it travels from country to country and connect to users who have taken an interest in their story by inviting other randomly selected users to contribute to their story. Users will be required to contribute to a number of preexisting stories before they will be able to start their own, however they will have a variety of stories to choose from, all coming with summaries of the authors vision for the plot. 

USE IT, LOVE IT, tell your friends.
